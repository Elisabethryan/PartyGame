# PartyGame

This is a small game I have created, feel free to play it!

This is a list of things I plan to implement as I continue working on the project:
- Adding words to the "word-sets" from the main menu 
(note that the game already reads from a file when a word-set is chosen and we have a functioning writeFile function) 
- Making the amount of sets dynamic and not dependant on buttons, the current solution is very ugly
- Copying a word-set
- The front-end for ScoreActivity
- Implementing motion sensoring for passing or getting a word correct
- Deleting words from the word-sets

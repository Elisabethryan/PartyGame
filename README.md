# PartyGame

This is a small game I have (re)created, feel free to play it! 
Choose a set of words to play, face the phone away from you towards a friend, they have to explain the word on the screen, if you guess correctly press the right side of the screen, to pass press the left side. The game goes on for 30 secs!

This is a list of things I plan to implement as I continue working on the project:
- Adding words to the "word-sets" from the main menu 
(note that the game already reads from a file when a word-set is chosen and we have a functioning writeFile function, the pop-up for a long click on a button is written for the first button) 
- Making the amount of sets dynamic and not dependant on buttons, the current solution is very ugly and needs to be fixed asap
- Copying a entire word-set
- The front-end for ScoreActivity
- Implementing motion sensoring for passing or getting a word correct
- Deleting words from the word-sets
- Fix a bug in the timer
